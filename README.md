National Park Biodiversity Analysis

This project explores biodiversity and conservation status across U.S. national parks using real-world species and observation data. The goal is to analyze species distribution, identify patterns in conservation status, and visualize species observations by park and category.

Project Objectives:

Analyze species distribution by park and category (e.g., Mammal, Bird, Plant)
Explore conservation status (Endangered, Threatened, etc.)
Visualize total species observations per park
Identify the most commonly observed species
Compare protected vs. non-protected species by type
Tools Used:

Python
Pandas – data wrangling and grouping
Seaborn / Matplotlib – data visualization
Jupyter Notebook
Data Sources:

species_info.csv – details on species name, category, and conservation status
observations.csv – number of times species were observed in different national parks
Sample Visualizations:

Bar charts showing total observations per park
Count plots for conservation statuses and species categories
Grouped charts comparing protection percentages by species type
Key Insight:
The most observed species across all parks is highlighted, and patterns show that certain categories (like mammals and birds) have higher protection needs.
